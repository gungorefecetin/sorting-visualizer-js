# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A beautiful, interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. This project helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work through visual representation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Adjustable array size (10-100 elements)
  - Variable sorting speed
  - Generate new random arrays
  - Real-time visualization

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Time elapsed
  - Number of comparisons
  - Array access count

## 💻 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- No external dependencies!

## 🎯 Algorithm Implementations

### Quick Sort
- Uses the divide-and-conquer strategy
- Average time complexity: O(n log n)
- Partition-based sorting

### Merge Sort
- Divide-and-conquer algorithm
- Stable sorting algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n log n)

### Heap Sort
- Binary heap data structure
- In-place sorting algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n log n)

### Bubble Sort
- Simple comparison-based algorithm
- Time complexity: O(n²)
- Great for educational purposes

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. **Open the project:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No build process or dependencies required!

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Generate New Array:**
   - Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array
   - Use the array size slider to adjust the number of elements

2. **Choose Algorithm:**
   - Select your desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu

3. **Adjust Speed:**
   - Use the speed slider to control the visualization speed
   - Move right for faster animation, left for slower

4. **Start Sorting:**
   - Click "Start Sorting" to begin the visualization
   - Watch the bars rearrange in real-time!

## 🎨 Visual Guide

- **Blue bars:** Unsorted elements
- **Yellow bars:** Elements being compared/swapped
- **Green bars:** Sorted elements
